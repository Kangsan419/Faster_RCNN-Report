## Dataset 

  I used PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge (2007) for the data set.
  
  anyone can access to the dataset through my Google Drive

## Training

  Testing environment was contructed on Google Colab.


## Result 

  There was several errors while I was runing the open source code. Thus, I was not able to look through the result on my own. It led to failing further analysis on Faster-RCNN algorithm.
  However, through leading the paper, carefully looking over to the original code, and python applied code in the github, the data shows considerable result on the algorithm.
  
  The main results is mentioned in the table below. 
  
  
  ### Main Results
|                           | training data                          | test data            | mAP   | time/img |
| ------------------------- |:--------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----:|:-----: |
| Faster RCNN, VGG-16       | VOC 2007 trainval                      | VOC 2007 test        | 69.9% | 198ms |


Seeing that it needs 198ms, but it still seems slower than Yolo algorithms.
